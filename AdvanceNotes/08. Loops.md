# **📘Learning Module: Loops in Java**

## **1. Learning Objectives**

After studying this material, you will be able to:

* Understand what loops are and why they are used in programming
* Distinguish between **while** and **do-while** loops in Java
* Recognize the flow and execution order of each loop
* Identify situations where one loop is more suitable than the other
* Read and interpret simple loop-based code examples

---

## **2. Key Concepts**

### **What is a Loop?**

A loop is a control structure used to **repeat a block of statements** until a specific condition changes.

### **Why Do We Need Loops?**

Many real-life and computational tasks require repeated steps—such as repeatedly dividing numbers when calculating LCM or repeatedly subtracting in GCD computation. Loops automate these repeated steps in programming.

### **Types of Loops in Java**

(Java provides 4, but this video discusses 2)

1. **while loop**
2. **do-while loop**

(Other loops mentioned but not covered here: `for` loop, `for-each` loop)

---

## **3. Detailed Breakdown**

### --------------------------------------

## **A. Understanding Repetition in Programs**

The transcript uses daily life examples:

* Finding GCD → repeated subtraction
* Finding LCM → repeated division
* Many computational procedures → steps repeated until a condition is met

When a process includes **repeated steps**, a loop is the correct programming tool.


## **B. Flowchart Representation of a Loop**

### **General Loop Structure**

1. Check a condition
2. If true → execute repeated process
3. Return to the condition
4. Continue until the condition becomes false
5. Exit the loop

This is the fundamental flow of all loop structures.

## **C. `while` Loop**

### **Syntax**

```java
while (condition) {
    // repeated statements
}
```

### **Execution Flow**

1. **Check condition first**
2. If condition is **true** → execute the loop body
3. Return to step 1
4. If condition is **false at the start**, **body does not execute even once**

### **Key Characteristics**

✔ Pre-tested loop
✔ Executes **0 or more times**
✔ If the condition is false initially → loop is skipped

---

### --------------------------------------

## **D. `do-while` Loop**

### **Syntax**

```java
do {
    // repeated statements
} while (condition);
```

(Note: ends with a semicolon)

### **Execution Flow**

1. **Execute loop body once** (no condition check yet)
2. Then check condition
3. If condition is **true**, repeat
4. If false → stop

### **Key Characteristics**

✔ Post-tested loop
✔ Executes **at least once**
✔ Useful when you must run the block before checking the condition
(e.g., taking user input before validating)

---

### --------------------------------------

## **E. Comparison: while vs do-while**

| Feature            | while                       | do-while                          |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Condition checked  | Before the loop             | After one execution               |
| Minimum executions | 0 times                     | 1 time                            |
| Use case           | When you may skip execution | When at least one run is required |

### Instructor’s Insight from Transcript:

* You **rarely** *require* a do-while loop specifically
* Most loops that work with do-while can be rewritten using while
* But do-while is handy when you *need* the body to run first

---

## --------------------------------------

## **F. Worked Example (Power of 2 values below 100)**

### Using **while loop**

```java
int i = 1;
int end = 100;

while (i < end) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i = i * 2;
}
```

### Using **do-while loop**

```java
int i = 1;
int end = 100;

do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i = i * 2;
} while (i < end);
```

### Output (for both loops):

```
1
2
4
8
16
32
64
```

Both produce the same output because the starting condition (i < 100) allows both loops to run multiple times.

---

## **4. Summary**

* Loops repeat steps until a condition becomes false
* `while` and `do-while` work similarly but differ in when the condition is checked
* `while` checks first → possible 0 executions
* `do-while` executes first → minimum 1 execution
* Both loops can generally be used interchangeably
* Only in certain cases (like mandatory first execution) is `do-while` preferable

---

## **5. Practical Applications**

You will use loops for tasks like:

* Iterating through user input
* Generating sequences (e.g., powers of 2, Fibonacci series)
* Running menus (do-while is common here)
* Processing data until a stop condition is met
* Repeated calculations until convergence

---

## **6. Self-Assessment Questions**

### **Conceptual**

1. What is the main purpose of loops in programming?
2. How is a `while` loop different from a `do-while` loop?
3. Why might a `do-while` loop be preferred when taking user input?

### **Code Understanding**

4. What will this code print?

```java
int x = 0;
while (x > 0) {
    System.out.println("Hello");
    x--;
}
```

5. What is the minimum number of times this executes?

```java
do {
    System.out.println("Run");
} while (false);
```

### **Application**

6. Write a loop (your choice of type) to print numbers from 10 down to 1.
7. Convert a `while` loop into a `do-while` loop that repeats until a number becomes 0.

### Practising Loops 
```java
package looppractice;

public class LoopPractice {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        //int i=1;//100
        /*while(i<100)
        {
            System.out.println(i);
            i=i*2;
        }*/
        
        /*do
        {
            System.out.println(i);
            i=i*2;
        }while(i<100);*/
        
        byte i=1;
        while(true)
        {
            System.out.println(i);
            i++;
        }
        
				// The above Infinite loop is equivalent to below if/else where else is never executed
        byte i=1;        
        if(true)
        {
            System.out.println(i);
            i++;
        }
        else
            System.out.println("Bye");
    }
    
}
```


#  **📘Learning Module: Understanding the For Loop (Counter-Controlled Loop)**

## **1. Learning Objectives**

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Distinguish between **while loops** (condition-controlled) and **for loops** (counter-controlled).
* Understand the structure and syntax of a **for loop**.
* Trace how execution flows through a for loop.
* Implement increasing and decreasing counter loops in code.
* Apply loops to real-life analogies to improve conceptual clarity.

---

## **2. Key Concepts**

### **A. Condition-Controlled Loop (while loop)**

* Runs **as long as a condition is true**.
* Used when the number of repetitions is **unknown beforehand**.

**Example (real-life analogy)**:
You add sugar to coffee **until** the coffee is sweet enough → You don’t know how many spoonfuls you’ll need.

---

### **B. Counter-Controlled Loop (for loop)**

* Runs a **specific number of times**.
* Used when you **know the exact number of repetitions**.

**Example (real-life analogy)**:
You decide to add **exactly 5 spoons** of sugar. No checking sweetness during the process → You repeat exactly 5 times.

---

### **C. For Loop Syntax (Common Structure)**

```c
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // body of the loop
}
```

Where:

1. **Initialization** — executed once before loop starts
2. **Condition** — checked before every iteration
3. **Update** — executed after each iteration
4. **Body** — main repeated statements

---

## **3. Detailed Breakdown**

### **3.1 Flow of a For Loop**

1. **Initialization** – executed once
2. **Condition check**

   * If true → execute body
   * If false → exit loop
3. **Execute body**
4. **Update step**
5. Go back to **condition**
6. Repeat until condition becomes false

This cycle continues:

> Condition → Process (body) → Update → Condition → ...

---

### **3.2 Example 1: Counting from 1 to 10**

```c
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
}
```

**Explanation:**

* Initialization: `i = 1`
* Condition: continue while `i <= 10`
* Update: `i++` (increment by 1 each iteration)
* Output: 1, 2, 3, …, 10

After `i` becomes 11, condition fails → loop stops.

---

### **3.3 Example 2: Counting Down from 10 to 1**

```c
for (int i = 10; i >= 1; i--) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
}
```

**Key insight:**
The **update step** can be `i--` (decrement) instead of `i++`.

This prints:
10, 9, 8, …, 1

---

### **3.4 Notes About Flexibility**

* Initialization can be any value.
* Condition can increase, decrease, or follow custom rules.
* Update can be:

  * `i++`
  * `i--`
  * `i += 2`
  * `i *= 3`, etc.

The loop is fully customizable based on the requirement.

---

## **4. Summary**

* **While loop** → when repetition count is unknown → controlled by a condition.
* **For loop** → when repetition count is known → controlled by a counter.
* For loop has three parts:

  1. Initialization (only once)
  2. Condition (checked each time)
  3. Update (after each iteration)
* Can count **upwards** or **downwards**.
* Useful for fixed-number tasks like printing 1 to 10.

---

## **5. Practical Applications**

You can apply for loops in programming wherever you need:

* Printing sequences
* Summing numbers
* Searching arrays
* Repeating actions a fixed number of times
* Counting down timers
* Iterating over list indices

---

## **6. Self-Assessment Questions**

1. When should you use a **while loop** instead of a **for loop**?
2. What are the **three components** of a for loop?
3. Write a for loop to print all even numbers from 2 to 20.
4. What happens if you forget to update the loop variable in a for loop?
5. Rewrite the loop below as a decreasing loop:

   ```c
   for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
       printf("%d", i);
   }
   ```

---


#  **📘Learning Module: Advanced For Loop Concepts & Variations**

## **1. Learning Objectives**

After completing this module, you will be able to:

* Understand all three components of a for loop: initialization, condition, update.
* Identify how a for loop executes step-by-step.
* Understand scope of loop variables.
* Write increasing and decreasing loops.
* Recognize infinite loop scenarios and how they occur accidentally.
* Understand optional components of a for loop.
* Declare and update multiple variables inside a for loop.

---

# **2. Key Concepts**

## **A. The Three Parts of a For Loop**

A for loop has three main sections:

```c
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // body
}
```

1. **Initialization** → Runs only once
2. **Condition** → Checked before each iteration
3. **Update (increment/decrement/operation)** → Runs after each iteration

Execution order:

> Initialization → Condition → Body → Update → Condition → Body → Update → …

---

## **B. Example: Counting from 0 to 10**

```c
for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
}
```

Step-by-step:

* `i = 0` (initialization)
* Check `i <= 10` → true → print 0
* `i++` → i becomes 1
* Check again → true → print 1
* …
* When `i = 11` → condition fails → loop stops

---

## **C. Debugging Insight**

Variables declared *inside* the for loop (e.g., `int i = 0`) **exist only inside the loop**.
Outside the loop, they become **unknown**.

---

## **D. Decrementing / Reverse Loop**

To count from 10 down to 1:

```c
for (int i = 10; i > 0; i--) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
}
```

**Common mistake:**
If you accidentally write `i++` in a decreasing loop:

```c
for (int i = 10; i > 0; i++) {   // ❌ wrong update
```

Then:

* `i` keeps increasing (10, 11, 12…)
* Condition `i > 0` remains true for a very long time
* Eventually integer overflow occurs → number becomes negative → loop stops.

➡️ Not truly infinite, but very large unintended loop.

---

## **E. Optional Components in a For Loop**

### **1. Initialization is optional**

```c
int i = 0;
for (; i <= 10; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
}
```

### **2. Update is optional**

Can be done inside the loop:

```c
for (int i = 0; i <= 10; ) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
    i++;
}
```

### **3. Condition is optional**

Removing it results in **infinite loop**:

```c
for (;;) {  
    // infinite loop
}
```

Same as:

```c
for (true;;)
```

**⚠️ Use with caution.**

---

## **F. Writing an Intentional Infinite Loop**

Two valid forms:

```c
for (;;)
```

or

```c
for (; true ; )
```

Both produce endless loops until a `break` is used.

---

## **G. Multiple Initializations & Updates**

### **Multiple variable declarations:**

```c
for (int i = 1, j = 1; i <= 5; i++, j *= 2) {
    printf("%d %d\n", i, j);
}
```

Rules:

* Variables must be of the **same data type**.
* Multiple items are separated by **commas**, not semicolons.

Output example:

```
1 1
2 2
3 4
4 8
5 16
```

Here:

* `i` increases linearly
* `j` doubles each iteration (exponential growth)

---

# **3. Summary**

* A **for loop** has initialization, condition, and update — all three are optional.
* Misplacing `++` or `--` can cause unintended long loops.
* Loop variables declared inside the loop are **not visible outside**.
* You can update **multiple variables** using commas.
* Infinite loops are possible using `for(;;)`.

---

# **4. Practical Applications**

Use these techniques when:

* Counting up or down through sequences
* Managing two related counters
* Writing timers or countdowns
* Performing repeated actions a fixed number of times
* Calculating exponential or arithmetic progressions
* Creating intentionally infinite loops (servers, polling, repeated prompts)

---
