# ✅ **Static Members**

The `static` keyword in Java is used to create **class-level members**.
These represent **metadata**: *data about the class*, not about individual objects.

Static members include:

* Static **variables**
* Static **methods**
* Static **nested classes**
* Static **blocks**

---

# 1️⃣ **Static Variables (Static Data Members)**

### 👉 What are they?

Variables declared with `static` inside a class.

```java
class HondaCity {
    static long price = 10;   // static variable
    int a;                    // non-static
    int b;                    // non-static
}
```

### 👉 Why do we use static variables?

Because static variables store **information about the class**, not about each object.

### Example context:

Honda City cars → price of the model.

* You buy a Honda City
* Your friend buys a Honda City
* **Price is the same for both objects**

Therefore:

* `price` **belongs to the class**
* **Not to objects**

### 👉 Memory behavior

* Only **ONE copy** is created
* Stored in **Method Area** of JVM
* Created when the class is **loaded**
* Exists **even if no objects are created**

### 👉 Accessing static variables

✔ Using object (allowed but not preferred):

```java
HondaCity h1 = new HondaCity();
System.out.println(h1.price); // prints 10
```

✔ Using class name (recommended):

```java
System.out.println(HondaCity.price); // prints 10
```

### 👉 Shared nature

If you update via ANY object:

```java
h1.price = 20;
System.out.println(h2.price); // prints 20
```

All objects see the **same updated value** because they share it.

---

# 2️⃣ **Static Methods**

### 👉 What are they?

Methods declared with `static` which operate on **class-level data**.

Example:

```java
static double onRoadPrice(String city) {
    if(city.equals("Delhi"))
        return price + price * 0.10;
    if(city.equals("Mumbai"))
        return price + price * 0.09;
    return price;
}
```

### 👉 Characteristics

| Feature        | Static Method                                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Belongs to     | Class                                                    |
| Can access     | Only static variables/methods                            |
| Cannot access  | Non-static members (`this`, `super`, instance variables) |
| Accessed using | Class name or object                                     |
| When used      | When logic belongs to the class                          |

### 👉 Access

✔ Using class name (best practice):

```java
HondaCity.onRoadPrice("Delhi");
```

✔ Using object (allowed):

```java
h1.onRoadPrice("Delhi");
```

---

# 3️⃣ **Static Nested Classes**

A class declared inside another class using `static`.

### Example:

```java
class HondaCity {
    static class Features {
        // static nested class
    }
}
```

### Key Points:

* Acts like a **normal class**, but **logically grouped** inside the outer class.
* Can access **only static members** of the outer class.
* Does NOT have reference to outer class object.
* Cannot use `this` or `super` (they refer to instance context).

### When to use?

If you have **many static methods or static data**, you can group them into a static nested class for better organization.

---

# 4️⃣ **Static Blocks**


A **static block** is used to initialize static members.

```java
static int price;
static {
    price = 10;
    System.out.println("Static block executed");
}
```

Runs:

* When class is loaded
* Before main() runs
* Only once

---

# ⭐ Quick Revision Points

### ✔ Static Variables

* Belongs to class, not objects
* One copy only
* Stored in method area
* Access via class name
* Shared among all objects

### ✔ Static Methods

* Can use only static members
* Cannot use `this` or `super`
* Called without creating object

### ✔ Static Nested Classes

* Group static members
* Access ONLY static data of outer class

### ✔ Static Blocks

* Initialize static members
* Runs when class loads

# ✅ **Demo  Static Members**


## **1. Class Structure**

```java
class Test {
    static int x = 10;   // static variable
    int y = 20;          // non-static variable

    void show() {        // non-static method
        System.out.println(x); // allowed
        System.out.println(y); // allowed
    }

    static void display() {    // static method
        System.out.println(x); // allowed
        System.out.println(y); // NOT allowed (gives error)
    }
}
```

---

## **A. Access Rules**

### ✔ A non-static method can access:

* static variables
* non-static variables

### ✔ A static method can access:

* static variables only

❌ A static method **cannot** access non-static variables
Trying to print `y` inside `display()` gives:

> *"Non-static variable cannot be referenced from a static context."*

---

## **B. Behavior with Multiple Objects**

Two objects are created:

```java
Test t1 = new Test();
Test t2 = new Test();
```

Initially:

* `x = 10` (static → shared by all objects)
* `y = 20` for each object (individual copy)

### When values are updated:

```java
t1.x = 30;
t1.y = 50;
```

### Results:

* `x` becomes **30 for both t1 and t2** → because it is static (shared)
* `y` becomes **50 only for t1**, t2 still has **20**

Later if `x` is changed again (e.g., to 100), this new value is reflected for *all* objects.

---

## **C. Static Classes**

You cannot declare an outer class as static:

```java
static class Test { } // ❌ Error
```

> Only **inner classes** can be static.
> Outer (top-level) classes cannot be static.

---

## **Final Key Points**

* `static` keyword creates **class-level members**, shared across all objects.
* Non-static members belong to **each object separately**.
* Static methods cannot access non-static fields directly.
* Only **inner classes** can be declared static.

# ✅ **Final Members**

The `final` keyword in Java is similar to `const` in C/C++.
It is used to **prevent modification, overriding, or inheritance** depending on where it is applied.

Java supports `final` in three forms:

1. **Final variables**
2. **Final methods**
3. **Final classes**

---

## 1️⃣ **Final Variables**

### ✔ Final variables are constants

Once a value is assigned, **it cannot be changed**.

Example:

```java
final int MINIMUM = 1;
final int NORMAL;
final int MAXIMUM;
```

### ✔ Naming convention

Final variables are usually written in **UPPERCASE**.

---

## ⭐ Ways to initialize final variables (3 methods)

### **1. Direct initialization**

```java
final int MINIMUM = 1;
```

### **2. Inside a static block**

```java
static {
    NORMAL = 10;
}
```

### **3. Inside a constructor**

```java
final int MAXIMUM;

Test() {
    MAXIMUM = 100;
}
```

⚠ If a class has multiple constructors, **every constructor must initialize the final variable**, otherwise the code won’t compile.

---

## ❌ Reassignment is not allowed

```java
MINIMUM = 5;   // ERROR: cannot assign a value to final variable
```

---

## 2️⃣ **Final Methods**

A method declared as `final` **cannot be overridden** in a subclass.

Example:

```java
class Super {
    final void method1() {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}

class Sub extends Super {
    void method1() { }   // ❌ ERROR: cannot override final method
}
```

### ✔ You can still:

* Inherit the method
* Call it from the subclass
* Add more methods in the subclass

But you **cannot redefine** the final method.

---

## 3️⃣ **Final Classes**

A class declared as `final` **cannot be extended**.

Example:

```java
final class Super { }

class Sub extends Super { }  // ❌ ERROR: cannot inherit from final class
```

### ✔ You can still:

* Create objects of the final class
* Use its methods

But not subclass it.

---

# 🔍 **Why use final? (Real-world use cases)**

### ✔ Define constants

Such as PI, LIMIT, MAX_SPEED.

### ✔ Prevent changes in critical code

If you don’t want someone to modify behavior:

* Make the method `final`.

### ✔ Maintain security or API policy

If you don't want other developers to extend a specific class:

* Make the class `final`.

### ✔ Protect your code when selling/licensing libraries

You may want them to use methods but not override or inherit from certain classes.
