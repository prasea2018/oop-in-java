# **UNIT 4: Inheritance, Packages and Interfaces in Java**

---

## **1. Inheritance in Java**

### **1.1 Meaning of Inheritance**

**Inheritance** is one of the most important features of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.
It allows a **new class** to acquire the **properties and behaviors** of an existing class.

**Exam Definition:**

> **Inheritance is a mechanism in Java by which one class inherits the variables and methods of another class.**

---

### **Advantages of Inheritance**

* **Code reusability**
* **Reduced redundancy**
* **Better organization**
* **Supports hierarchical classification**
* **Improves maintainability**

---

## **1.2 Using the `extends` Keyword**

In Java, inheritance is implemented using the **`extends` keyword**.

### **Syntax**

```java
class SubClass extends SuperClass {
  // members
}
```

---

### **Example**

```java
class Animal {
  void eat() {
    System.out.println("Animal eats food");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  void bark() {
    System.out.println("Dog barks");
  }
}
```

Here:

* `Animal` → **Superclass**
* `Dog` → **Subclass**

---

1. What is inheritance?
2. Which keyword is used to implement inheritance in Java?

---

## **Subclasses and Superclasses**

### **Superclass**

* The class whose properties are inherited
* Also called **parent class** or **base class**

### **Subclass**

* The class that inherits properties
* Also called **child class** or **derived class**

**Important Rule:**
A subclass can access **public** and **protected** members of the superclass.

---

### **Types of Inheritance Supported by Java**

* Single inheritance ✅
* Multilevel inheritance ✅
* Hierarchical inheritance ✅
❌ Multiple inheritance using classes is **not supported** (to avoid ambiguity).


#### 1. Single Inheritance

In single inheritance, a sub-class is derived from only one super class. It inherits the properties and behavior of a single-parent class. Sometimes, it is also known as simple inheritance.

```java
//Super class
class Vehicle {
  Vehicle() {
    System.out.println("This is a Vehicle");
  }
}

// Subclass
class Car extends Vehicle {
  Car() {
    System.out.println("This Vehicle is Car");
  }
}

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Creating object of subclass invokes base class constructor
    Car obj = new Car();
  }
}
```

#### 2. Multilevel Inheritance

In Multilevel Inheritance, a derived class will be inheriting a base class and as well as the derived class also acts as the base class for other classes.

```java
class Vehicle {
  Vehicle() {
    System.out.println("This is a Vehicle");
  }
}
class FourWheeler extends Vehicle {
  FourWheeler() {
    System.out.println("4 Wheeler Vehicles");
  }
}
class Car extends FourWheeler {
  Car() {
    System.out.println("This 4 Wheeler Vehicle is a Car");
  }
}
public class Geeks {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Car obj = new Car(); // Triggers all constructors in order
  }
}
```
#### 3. Hierarchical Inheritance
In hierarchical inheritance, more than one subclass is inherited from a single base class. i.e. more than one derived class is created from a single base class. For example, cars and buses both are vehicle
```java 
class Vehicle {
  Vehicle() {
    System.out.println("This is a Vehicle");
  }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  Car() {
    System.out.println("This Vehicle is Car");
  }
}

class Bus extends Vehicle {
  Bus() {
    System.out.println("This Vehicle is Bus");
  }
}

public class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Car obj1 = new Car(); 
    Bus obj2 = new Bus(); 
  }
}
```

#### 4. Hybrid Inheritance
It is a mix of two or more of the above types of inheritance. In Java, we can achieve hybrid inheritance only through Interfaces if we want to involve multiple inheritance to implement Hybrid inheritance.
- class Car extends Vehicle->Single Inheritance
- class Bus extends Vehicle and class Bus implements Interface Fare->Hybrid Inheritance (since Bus inherits from two sources, forming a combination of single + multiple inheritance).

---

## **The `super` Keyword**

The **`super` keyword** is used to refer to the **immediate parent class object**.

---

### **Uses of `super` Keyword**

#### **1. Access superclass variables**

```java
super.variableName;
```

#### **2. Call superclass methods**

```java
super.methodName();
```

#### **3. Call superclass constructor**

```java
super();
```

---

### **Example**

```java
class Univeristy{
  String universityName = "TU";

  public University() {
    System.out.println("I am University");
  }

  public void displayUniversityName() {
    System.out.println("The univerisy name is " + universityName);
  }
}

class College extends University {
  String collegeName = "Golden Gate";

  public College() {
    super(); //Call superclass constructor
    super.displayUniversityName(); //Call superclass methods
    System.out.println(super.universityName); //Access superclass variables  
    System.out.prinln("I am College");
  }
}
```

## **Method Overriding**

### **Meaning of Method Overriding**

**Method overriding** occurs when:

* A subclass provides a **specific implementation** of a method already defined in its superclass.

> Method overriding allows a subclass to redefine a method of its superclass.

---

### **Rules for Method Overriding**

* Method name must be the same
* Parameter list must be the same
* Inheritance must exist
* Return type must be same
* Access level cannot be reduced

---

### **Example**

```java
class Animal {
  void sound() {
    System.out.println("Animal makes sound");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  void sound() {
    System.out.println("Dog barks");
  }
}
```

---

1. What is method overriding?
2. Can static methods be overridden?

---

## **Dynamic Method Dispatch**

### **Meaning**

**Dynamic Method Dispatch** is a mechanism by which a **call to an overridden method** is resolved **at runtime** rather than compile time.

This supports **runtime polymorphism**.

---

### **Example**

```java
class Animal {
  void sound() {
    System.out.println("Animal makes sound");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  void sound() {
    System.out.println("Dog barks");
  }
}
public class TestDispatch {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Animal a;
    a = new Dog();
    a.sound();
  }
}
```

Output: Dog barks


The method is decided based on **object type**, not reference type. Since the object type is of Dog() not Animal(), hence sound() of Dog is called. 

---

1. What is dynamic method dispatch?
2. Is it resolved at compile time or runtime?

---

## **2. The Object Class**

### **Meaning**

The **Object class** is the **root class** of all Java classes.

Every class in Java implicitly extends `Object`.

---

### **Common Methods of Object Class**

* `toString()`
* `equals()`
* `hashCode()`
* `getClass()`
* `clone()`

---

### **Example**

```java
class Test {
}
```

Internally:

```java
class Test extends Object {
}
```


## **3. Abstract Classes**

### **Meaning**

An **abstract class** is a class that:

* Cannot be instantiated
* May contain **abstract methods**

Declared using the `abstract` keyword.

---

### **Abstract Method**

A method without a body.

```java
abstract void show();
```

---

### **Example**

```java
abstract class Shape {
  abstract void draw();
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  void draw() {
      System.out.println("Drawing Circle");
  }
}
```

---

### **Rules**

* Abstract class may contain concrete methods
* Subclass must implement all abstract methods
* Constructors are allowed

---

1. Can we create an object of abstract class?
2. Why are abstract classes used?

---

## **4. Final Classes**

### **Final Class**

A class declared with `final` cannot be inherited.

```java
final class Security {
}
```

Used for **security and performance**

---

### **Final Method**

Cannot be overridden.

### **Final Variable**

Value cannot be changed (constant).

---

1. Why is a class declared final?
2. Can final methods be overridden?

---

## **5. Packages in Java**

### **Meaning of Package**

A **package** is a **group of related classes and interfaces**.

Used for:

* Code organization
* Reusability
* Access protection

---

## **5.1 Defining a Package**

### **Syntax**

```java
package mypackage;
```

---

### **Example**

```java
package bank;

class Account {
}
```

Must be the **first statement** in source file.

---

## **5.2 Importing a Package**

### **Syntax**

```java
import packageName.ClassName;
import packageName.*;
```

---

### **Example**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```

---

## **5.3 Access Control**

Java provides **four access specifiers**:

| Modifier  | Scope                   |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| public    | Everywhere              |
| protected | Same package + subclass |
| default   | Same package            |
| private   | Same class only         |

---

1. What is the use of packages?
2. Which access modifier is most restrictive?

---

## **6. Interfaces in Java**

---

## **6.1 Defining an Interface**

An **interface** is a collection of **abstract methods and constants**.

Declared using `interface` keyword.

---

### **Syntax**

```java
interface MyInterface {
    void show();
}
```

---

### **Rules**

* Methods are public and abstract by default
* Variables are public, static, and final
* No constructors

---

## **6.2 Implementing Interfaces**

A class implements an interface using `implements` keyword.

---

### **Example**

```java
interface Animal {
    void sound();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}
```

---

### **Multiple Inheritance Using Interfaces**

Java allows **multiple inheritance using interfaces**.

```java
class A implements B, C {
}
```

---

### 🧠 Practice Questions

1. Difference between interface and abstract class?
2. Can a class implement multiple interfaces?
