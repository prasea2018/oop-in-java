# **Unit 1: Introduction to Java**

---

## **1. Definition of Java**

**Java** is a **high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language** developed by **Sun Microsystems** (now owned by **Oracle Corporation**).

## **Key Features(Buzzword) of Java**

* **Object-Oriented** – Uses classes and objects
* **Platform Independent** – *Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)*
* **Secure** – No direct memory access
* **Robust** – Strong memory management and exception handling
* **Multithreaded** – Supports concurrent execution
* **Portable** – Same bytecode runs on any JVM


#### **1. Simple**

* Java syntax is similar to **C** and **C++**, making it easy for programmers coming from those languages.
* Even beginners can learn Java easily because the syntax is clean and English-like.
* Unnecessary complex features of C/C++ (like pointers, operator overloading, multiple inheritance of classes) are removed to keep Java simple.

#### **2. Secure**

* Java provides strong security because programs run inside the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**.
* JVM uses:

  * **Class Loader**
  * **Bytecode Verifier**
  * **Security Manager**
* These components ensure:

  * No malicious code is executed
  * No unauthorized memory access
  * Programs cannot cause virus-like behavior

Thus, Java programs run safely and are protected from malware.


#### **3. Object-Oriented**

* Java supports all OOP principles:

  * **Abstraction**
  * **Encapsulation**
  * **Inheritance**
  * **Polymorphism**
* OOP makes programs modular, reusable, flexible, and easy to maintain.
* Objects and classes help model real-world entities.

#### **3. Platform Independent**

* Java is independent of hardware architecture.
*Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)*
* It does not depend on:

  * Von Neumann architecture
  * ARM architecture
  * RISC / CISC CPUs
* JVM acts as a layer between Java code and the underlying processor.
* Therefore, Java runs on any architecture where JVM is available.

#### **4. Robust**

* Java is strong and reliable.
* It handles run-time errors using **exception handling**.
* It removes memory errors by:

  * Automatic **Garbage Collection**
  * No pointer manipulation
* Even if resources are unavailable at run-time, Java programs do not crash easily.


#### **5. Multithreaded**

* Java supports **multithreading**, meaning:

  * A program can be broken into multiple threads.
  * All threads run **simultaneously**.
* Helpful for:

  * Animations
  * Games
  * Servers
  * Concurrent processing



## **6. Interpreted**

* Java uses an **interpreter** (JVM) to execute bytecode line-by-line.
* Earlier Java versions were slow due to interpretation only.
* Later, **JIT compiler (Just-In-Time)** was added to improve performance.



### 🔹 Example

A simple Java statement:

```java
class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Welcome to Java");
  }
}
```

1. Why is Java called a **platform-independent** language?
2. List any four features of Java.

---

## **2. History of Java**

### **Evolution of Java**

* **1991** – Project started by **James Gosling** at Sun Microsystems
* Initially named **Oak**
* Renamed **Java** in **1995**
* Designed for **embedded systems and web applications**

### **Major Java Versions**

| Version  | Year | Key Feature                 |
| -------- | ---- | --------------------------- |
| Java 1.0 | 1996 | First release               |
| Java 5   | 2004 | Generics, Enhanced for-loop |
| Java 8   | 2014 | Lambda expressions          |
| Java 17  | 2021 | Long-term support           |

**Father of Java:** **James Gosling**

---

### Activity

* Find two real-world systems where Java is used today.

---

## **3. The Internet and Java's Place in IT**

Java gained popularity due to its strong integration with the **Internet**.

### **Role of Java in IT**

* Web Applications
* Enterprise Systems
* Mobile Applications (Android)
* Banking Systems
* Cloud-based Applications

### **Why Java for Internet Applications?**

* Secure execution using JVM
* Platform-independent bytecode
* Supports networking APIs

**Case Study: Banking Systems**
Most banks (including Nepalese banks) use **Java-based core banking systems** because of security and scalability.



## **4. Applications and Applets**

### **Java Applications**

* Standalone programs
* Run on a local machine
* Have a `main()` method


```java
public class Hello {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello Java Application");
  }
}
```

---

### **Java Applets**

* Small Java programs
* Embedded in web pages
* Run inside a browser (obsolete now)

**Difference Between Application and Applet**

| Application        | Applet              |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Runs independently | Runs inside browser |
| Uses `main()`      | No `main()` method  |
| More powerful      | Restricted access   |

**Note:** Applets are no longer supported in modern browsers, but included for **academic understanding**.

## **5. Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**

### **What is JVM?**

**JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** is an abstract machine that:

* Executes Java **bytecode**
* Converts bytecode into machine code
* Makes Java platform-independent

**Key Role:**

> JVM acts as a **translator between Java bytecode and the operating system.**

---

### **JVM Architecture**

* Class Loader
* Memory Area
* Execution Engine
* Garbage Collector


---

## **6. Bytecode – Not an Executable Code**

### **What is Bytecode?**

* Intermediate code generated after compilation
* Stored in `.class` file
* Cannot run directly on hardware

**Important Point:**

> **Bytecode is NOT machine code. It requires JVM to execute.**

---

### **Compilation Process**

```text
Java Source (.java)
       ↓ (javac)
Bytecode (.class)
       ↓ (JVM)
Machine Code
```

---

## **7. Procedure-Oriented vs Object-Oriented Programming**

### **Procedure-Oriented Programming (POP)**

* Focus on functions
* Data is exposed
* Example: C

### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

* Focus on objects
* Data hiding using encapsulation
* Example: Java

**Comparison Table**

| POP                   | OOP              |
| --------------------- | ---------------- |
| Function-based        | Object-based     |
| Less secure           | More secure      |
| Difficult to maintain | Easy maintenance |

## **8. Compiling and Running a Simple Java Program**

### **Steps to Compile and Run**

1. Write program in a `.java` file
2. Compile using:

```bash
javac ProgramName.java
```

3. Run using:

```bash
java ProgramName
```

---

### **Example Program**

```java
class Welcome {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Welcome to Core Java");
  }
}
```

---

## **9. Setting Up Java Environment**

### **Steps**

1. Install **JDK**
2. Set **PATH** environment variable
3. Verify installation:

```bash
java -version
```

**JDK vs JRE**

* **JDK** – Development
* **JRE** – Execution only

---

## **10. Writing, Compiling, Interpreting, and Running a Program**

### **Complete Workflow**

1. Write code in editor
2. Compile using `javac`
3. JVM interprets bytecode
4. Output displayed

---


## **11. Handling Common Errors**

### **Types of Errors**

1. **Compile-Time Errors**

   * Syntax errors
   * Missing semicolon

2. **Runtime Errors**

   * Division by zero
   * Null pointer exception

3. **Logical Errors**

   * Wrong output


```java
System.out.println("Hello") // missing semicolon
```
